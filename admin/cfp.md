**Tentative Title:** The Next Steps for Research on R&R in the Cartographic and Geographic Information Sciences 

**Guest Editors:** Peter Kedron, Joseph Holler

**Synopsis:** Reproducibility and replicability are increasingly recognized as essential characteristics of open science and of scientific research publications (NASEM 2019 doi:10.17226/25303, NSF Dear Colleague Letter 23-018). 
Reproducibility is the ability to repeat a prior study with the same data and produce the same results, offering opportunities to check the internal validity of the study and to enhance the transparency and efficiency of scientific communication and open science. 
Replicability is the ability to repeat a prior study's design and procedures with new data and confirm the same findings, offering opportunities to verify the external validity and generalizability of the prior findings. 
Together, reproductions and replications are a means by which the scientific community can verify, correct, and improve the claims that science makes about phenomena. 
Furthermore, reproducibility and replicability can enhance the credibility and reliability of research for informing public policy and enhancing public trust. 
Conversely, the lack of reproducibility is increasingly becoming a barrier between scientific research and public action to enact sustainability solutions.

In keeping with the discipline's diverse and often debated traditions, attention to R&R has been slower to develop in geography than in other fields (Sui and Kedron, 2021; Kedron and Holler 2021). 
The heterogeneities and dependencies that characterizes geographic phenomena suggest that the use of R&R to check and extend the claims of prior work may be difficult and may even necessitate the recognition that replication across space and time must be weak (Goodchild and Li, 2021). 
However, those challenges also offer opportunities and there is reason to believe that spatial data-intensive and computationally-intensive geographical sciences present both unique challenges to achieving R&R and unique opportunities to examine and advance R&R as an epistomological tool.

To that end, we invite research paper presentations that advance reproducibility and/or replicability (R&R) in the cartographic and geographic information sciences. 
We encourage submissions that develop new R&R related infrastructure, examine a subfield of GISciece in light of R&R, or introduce R&R-related advances made in other fields into cartography and GIScience. 
We also encourage review and perspective that extend past simply summaries of the current state of the field and offer new insights into where a focus on R&R might take geographic information science. 
Finally, we encourage the submission of high-quality attempts to reproducing important studies, or replication attempts that seek to test existing methods and explanations in new geographic contexts. 

**Timeline**
- Send out call for papers: March 2023
- Submission Deadline: July 31, 2023
- Complete peer-review process: January 31, 2024
